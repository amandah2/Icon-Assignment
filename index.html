      <h1>What is a food swamp and what does this mean for the Bronx?</h1>
      <p>
The Bronx has one of the highest rates of food insecurity in the country and is described as a "food swamp." But exactly does that term “food swamp” mean and what are some of the effects on the borough?

      <div class="text">Food swamps are areas where residents have restricted access to affordable, healthy food options due to geographic distance from a grocery store. In NYC in recent years, economic factors such as high rent prices have caused many grocery stores to close. This makes many residents' commute long and sometimes difficult if they have to take multiple forms of public transportation to get to their neighborhood grocery store.

      <div class="text">You may have heard of the term “food desert” but “food swamp” refers to areas with a high density of fast-food chains and limited access to nutritional food sources. More than one in three South Bronx residents consumes one or more sugary drinks each day, higher than New York City as a whole (24%). </div>

      <div class="text">Limited access to nutritional and healthy food options can increase health risks such as obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure. According to the NYC food policy center’s report, 20% of residents in the South Bronx has been diagnosed with diabetes vs. 12% in NYC. Factors such as drinking a soda once a day can increase an individual’s risk of developing diabetes by 18%.

      <div class="text">Some solutions are community gardens and bodegas providing more nutritious food options. The city launched the “Healthy Bodega” initiative to work with bodegas to carry more healthy food options in areas like the South Bronx.
